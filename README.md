# Setiment-Analysis
This project Aims to identifies This Reviews are positive or negative of the company product  or application reviews this sentiment analysis in variety of setting particularly for marketing  purposes.
Data Collection:
Gather a dataset of reviews related to the company's products or applications. This dataset should include a mix of positive and negative reviews to train and evaluate your model effectively.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the text data to remove irrelevant information, such as stop words, special characters, and HTML tags. Tokenize the text into individual words or phrases.

Labeling:
Manually or automatically label the reviews in your dataset as positive or negative. This labeled dataset will be used to train your sentiment analysis model.

Feature Extraction:
Convert the text data into numerical representations that can be fed into a machine learning model. Common techniques include using Bag of Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), or word embeddings.

Model Selection:
Choose a suitable machine learning model for sentiment analysis. Common choices include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, or more advanced models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer-based models.

Training:
Train your selected model on the labeled dataset. This involves feeding the input data into the model, adjusting the model's parameters during the training process, and evaluating its performance on a validation set.

Evaluation:
Assess the performance of your model using a separate test dataset. Common evaluation metrics for sentiment analysis include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Deployment:
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to analyze new reviews and classify them as positive or negative.

Monitoring and Improvement:
Regularly monitor the model's performance and update it as needed. Sentiment analysis models may need periodic retraining to adapt to changes in language use or product/service features
